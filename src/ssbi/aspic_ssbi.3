.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I ssbi1
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha > 0'
and 'beta > 0', in the large field region 'x > xeps1max' and proceeds
at decreasing field values. The quantity 'xeps1max' is the field value
at which the first Hubble flow function is maximal. It is returned by
the
.I
real(kp)
function
.BR ssbi1_x_epsonemax (alpha,beta).

Inflation naturally ends at 'xend' but only if the parameters are such
that the maximal value for the first Hubble flow function is greater
than unity. This is the case provided 'alpha >
.BR ssbi1_alphamin (beta)'
and 'xend' is given by the function
.BR ssbi1_x_endinf (alpha,beta).

The field space 'x < xeps1max' could also support inflation but it
would have to stop by a yet to specified instability mechanism. The
end of inflation would be an extra-model parameter and, as such, this
case is not studied here.

The
.I ssbi2
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha < 0'
and 'beta < 0', in the small field region '0 < x < xVzero', and proceeds
at increasing field values. The quantity 'xVzero' is the field value
at which the potential vanishes and is given by
.BR ssbi2_x_potzero (alpha,beta).

In this domain, inflation naturally ends at 'xend', returned by the
function
.BR ssbi2_x_endinf (alpha,beta).

The
.I ssbi3
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha > 0'
and 'beta < 0', in the small field region '0 < x < xVmax', and
proceeds at decreasing field values. The quantity 'xVmax' is the field value
at which the potential is maximal and given by
.BR ssbi3_x_potmax (alpha,beta).

Along a hypothetical field trajectory starting around 'xVmax', the
first Hubble flow function increases from zero to a maximum at 'x =
xeps1max' and goes down to zero. As for the
.I ssbi1
case, inflation naturally ends only if this maximum is greater than
unity, which happens again only for 'alpha >
.BR ssbi3_alphamin (beta)'.
In that situation, 'xend' is given by the function
.BR ssbi3_x_endinf (alpha,beta).

The
.I ssbi4
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha > 0'
and 'beta < 0', in the large field region 'xVmax < x < xVzero', and
proceeds at increasing field values. The quantity 'xVmax' is the same
as for the
.I ssbi3
case while 'xVzero' is the same as for the
.I ssbi2
case. Both are returned by the
.I
real(kp)
functions
.IP
.BR ssbi4_x_potmax (alpha,beta)
.RS
.BR ssbi4_x_potzero (alpha,beta)
.RE
.P
respectively.

The
.I ssbi5
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha < 0'
and 'beta > 0', in the small field region '0 < x < xeps1max < xVzero',
and proceeds at increasing field values. The quantities 'xVzero'
and 'xeps1max' stand for the field value at which the potential
vanishes and at which the first Hubble flow function is maximal. Both
are given by the
.I
real(kp)
functions
.IP
.BR ssbi5_x_potzero (alpha,beta)
.RS
.BR ssbi5_x_epsonemax (alpha,beta)
.RE
.P
respectively. Inflation naturally ends only if 'alpha <
.BR ssbi5_alphamax (beta)'.
In that situation, the field value 'xend' is given by
.BR ssbi5_x_endinf (alpha,beta).

The
.I ssbi6
module is used for spontaneous symmetry breaking inflation for 'alpha < 0'
and 'beta > 0', in the large field region 'max(xeps1max,xVzero) < x',
and proceeds at decreasing field values. The quantities 'xVzero'
and 'xeps1max' have the same meaning as before and given by the
.I
real(kp)
functions
.IP
.BR ssbi6_x_potzero (alpha,beta)
.RS
.BR ssbi6_x_epsonemax (alpha,beta)
.RE
.P
respectively.
