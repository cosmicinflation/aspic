.SH NAME
.I lmi2
- the logamediate inflation II module

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 20
Physical potential
V(phi) = M^4 x^[4(1-gamma)] exp[-beta x^gamma]

.TP
Routine units
.I real(kp)
::
.B x
= phi/Mp
.TP
Parameters
.I real(kp)
::
.B gamma, beta

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I lmi2
module is used for the logamediate inflation at large field values,
namely in the region for which 'x > xiniMin=max(xVmax,xeps1)'. As for the
.I lmi1
module, 'xVmax' is the field value at which the potential is maximal
while 'xeps1' is the field value at which the first Hubble flow
function may equal unity in the large field region ('x >
xVmax'). Notice that since the later does not exist for all
parameter values, we provide a
.I
real(kp)
function
.IP
.BR lmi2_xini_min (gamma,beta)
.P
which always returns the value of 'xiniMin'.

In this regime, inflation never ends and the field
value 'xend' is an extra model parameter that has to be specified. As
the result, the function
.BR lmi2_x_endinf ()
is not provided.

This model shares a few peculiar functions with
.I lmi1
in a module named
.BR lmicommon .
The value of 'xvMax' is returned by
.BR lmi_x_max_potential (gamma,beta)
accessible through
.IP
.B use lmicommon, only : lmi_x_max_potential

.SH NOTES
For the model parameter values such that 'xeps1' exists, logamediate
inflation exhibits a third domain, 'xVmax < x < xeps1', in which
inflation could occur and would naturally ends at 'x=xeps1'. However,
this domain requires an extreme fine tuning of the initial field value
to get the required number of e-folds and is infinitely closed to a
pure de-Sitter model. This case has not been numerically implemented
but a discussion can be found in
.UR http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5525
