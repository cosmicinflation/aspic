.SH NAME
.I nfi1
- the N-formalism inflation module for a > 0, b > 1 and x > 0

.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 20
Physical potential
V(phi) = M^4 exp( a x^b )
.TP
Routine units
.I real(kp)
::
.B x
= phi/Mp
.TP
Parameters
.I real(kp)
::
.B a, b

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I nfi1
module is used for N-formalism inflation when 'a > 0' and 'b > 1', in
the positive field value region 'x > 0'. Inflation proceeds
at increasing field values and naturally ends at 'xend' which is
returned by the
.I
real(kp)
function
.BR nfi1_x_endinf (alpha,beta).

When the parameter 'b' is an even integer, the potential is symmetric
in the negative 'x' domain and inflation proceeds exactly as described
here. When 'b' is an odd integer, the potential has an inflection
point at 'x = 0'. Inflation within the domain 'x > 0' can still be
described by
.I nfi1
but may also evolve from 'x < 0' to 'x > 0'. This particular case is
handled by the
.I nfi7
module.

For '1 < b < 2', the maximal number of efolds from 'x = 0' to 'xend' is
finite while for 'b > 2' it can be infinite as inflation may occur
around 'x = 0'. In that case, the minimal field value under which the
first Hubble flow function becomes smaller than the numerical
precision is given by the
.I
real(kp)
function
.BR nfi1_numacc_xinimin (a,b).

Some functions are shared with others
.I nfi
modules in
.BR nficommon
and
.BR nficomreh
