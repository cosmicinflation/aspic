This package compiles and install the shared library libsrmodels. It
contains diverse functions for an exhaustive list of models allowing
to compute their inflationary predictions, in the slow-roll
approximations.

* Compilation and installation of the library
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  
  See INSTALL for more options.

* Testing each models individually
  ./configure
  make check

  In each model subdirectory (located under src/), a test program
  print and generate slow-roll predictions for various values of the
  reheating energy density.
