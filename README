This package compiles and install the shared scientific library
libsrmodels.

This is a collection of functions associated with various inflationary
models that allow an easy computation of their respective observable
predictions, in the slow-roll approximation. The library aims at
implementing all of the inflationary models proposed so far. It is
therefore released as GNU software, you are free and welcome to expand
this code and distribute the source code along the rules specified in
COPYING.

* Compilation and installation of the library
  ./configure
  make
  make install
  
  See INSTALL for more options.

* Testing each models individually
  ./configure
  make check

  In each model subdirectory (located under src/), a test program
  print and generate slow-roll predictions for various values of the
  reheating energy density.
