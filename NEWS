* version 1.1.0 (COVID release)

- Change of API in essentially all reheating routines:
  By default, all reheating routines take "xend" as an argument, to be
  passed after the list of regular potential model parameters. That
  used to be the case if xend were a model parameter. Now, even if
  xend is not a model parameter, it has to be precomputed by calling

       xend = foo_x_endinf()

  before any calls to reheating routines.

- Support for OpenMP:
  By default, the aspic library is compiled with "-fopenmp". Some
  checks being super long, such as for Dual Inflation, the main test
  programs have been parallelized. This can be disabled using:

       ./configure --disable-openmp

  at compilation time.
       
- Plotting python routines added in the directory "plots". Check the
  readme file for usage.

- A bunch of new models added!
