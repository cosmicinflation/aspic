* v0.0.10

- Models renamed, parameter values modified. ssi->ssbi, mni et pni
  merged into ni.

- Fixing rcqi to have numerical integration of the slow-roll
  trajectory

- Adding numerical integration of the slow-roll trajectory for kmiii,
  but only as an option for x beta^4/3 <= switch = 1. For the domain
  of validity of kmiii, our approximation is fine.
