* v0.0.7

- 9 new models imported
  (mssmi,twi,gmssmi,bsusybi,ti,psni,ncki,vhi,dsi), check ChangeLog

- Adding g* correction factor into Rrad (cosmopar + srreheat trivial changes)

- Remove obsoletes pause statements, fix libssi build

- Moving beta_mssm to mssmsr instead of common module

- Adding optional mu variable to potentials even when they do not need
  it; this allows to respect our convention that sr functions take all
  parameters as arguments without breaking codes not specifying it on
  input. This fix has been also applied to older models: sfi, dwi,
  mhi, ti, psni, dsi, vhi.

- Adding new functions and fix some stuff into dsisr. Former dsi_x_min
  renamed dsi_xinimin, wrote new function dsi_xendmin(efold,p,mu)
  working with the number of efolds. Check out the module for more
  details.

- Adding new functions and fix some stuff into vhisr. Same as dsi,
  xendmin(max) function renamed according to what they really compute
  and added new function vhi_xendmax(efold,p,mu). Check out the module
  for more details.

- Fix reheat function names in sfi/rmi/bi, they should be x_star() not
  x_reheat()?

- Adding new function x_potmax() in nckisr

- Fix bug in psnisr, the potential had the wrong sign (- instead of +)!?

- Man files completed

- Merge mlfi and gmi into gmlfi. Functions changed for compatibility,
  new order is p,q,alpha
