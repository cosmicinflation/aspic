* v0.0.9

- 8 new models imported, cleaned, with some functions added the
  fieldinf:
  csi, oi, cnci, sbi, ssi, rmi, lpi, cndi, check ChangeLog

- Clean internal messed-up convention, all find_foostuff() functions
  have been renamed as find_foo_stuff()

- Renaming and cleaning mssmi directory. All *_gen_* functions were
  redundant, renamed mssmi -> gmssmi. I check all generated files
  *.dat, I am pretty sure I did not introduce any bug. However,
  mssmimain generates a lot of NaN!?
