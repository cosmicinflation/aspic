* version 0.3.2 (charlie release)

- added models nfi, ccsi

- splitting 'srflow' into two modules: 'huflow' that contains formulae
  valid at any order in the Hubble flow functions; and 'srflow' that
  map the epsilonV hierarchy to the Hubble flow functions. Changes are
  backward compatible and calls should still be made to 'srflow'
  functions.

- added running and running of running functions in 'huflow'/'srflow'
  modules.

- various bugs and precision issues fixed
