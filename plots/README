* Python utilities to draw plots from the output of any main
  programs. Remember to actually run the main programs before!

* Example usage within the "plots" directory:

  - Higgs inflation:

      python ./fooiplots.py ../src/hi hi slowroll
      python ./fooiplots.py ../src/hi hi powerlaw      	     

  - Spontaneous symmetry breaking 3

      python ./fooiplots.py ../src/ssbi ssbi3 slowroll
      python ./fooiplots.py ../src/ssbi ssbi3 powerlaw

* For more advanced options, check out

      python ./fooiplots.py --help

NB: you can add contour plot showing one- and two-sigma constraints
    only by providing the contour files, see the source file fooiplots.py.
